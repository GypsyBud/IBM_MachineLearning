#Polynomial regression
'''
Sometimes, the trend of data is not really linear, and looks curvy. 
In this case we can use Polynomial regression methods. 
In fact, many different regressions exist that can be used to fit whatever the dataset looks like,
such as quadratic, cubic, and so on, and it can go on and on to infinite degrees.

In essence, we can call all of these, polynomial regression, 
where the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y 
is modeled as an nth degree polynomial in x. Lets say you want to have a polynomial regression 
(let's make 2 degree polynomial):

洧녽=洧녪+洧랚1洧논+洧랚2洧논^2
Now, the question is: how we can fit our data on this equation 
while we have only x values, such as Engine Size? 
Well, we can create a few additional features: 1,  洧논 , and  洧논2 .

PloynomialFeatures() function in Scikit-learn library, drives a new feature sets from the original feature set. 
That is, a matrix will be generated consisting of all polynomial combinations of the features with degree less than or equal to the specified degree. For example, lets say the original feature set has only one feature, ENGINESIZE. Now, if we select the degree of the polynomial to be 2, then it generates 3 features, degree=0, degree=1 and degree=2:
'''


# In[7]:


from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn import linear_model
train_x = np.asanyarray(train[['ENGINESIZE']])
train_y = np.asanyarray(train[['CO2EMISSIONS']])

test_x = np.asanyarray(test[['ENGINESIZE']])
test_y = np.asanyarray(test[['CO2EMISSIONS']])


poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
train_x_poly = poly.fit_transform(train_x)

'''
It looks like feature sets for multiple linear regression analysis, right? 
Yes. It Does. Indeed, Polynomial regression is a special case of linear regression, 
with the main idea of how do you select your features. 
Just consider replacing the  洧논  with  洧논1 ,  洧논21  with  洧논2 , and so on. Then the degree 2 equation would be turn into:

洧녽=洧녪+洧랚1洧논1+洧랚2洧논2 

Now, we can deal with it as 'linear regression' problem. 
Therefore, this polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of traditional multiple linear regression. 
So, you can use the same mechanism as linear regression to solve such a problems.

so we can use LinearRegression() function to solve it:
'''


# In[8]:


clf = linear_model.LinearRegression()
train_y_ = clf.fit(train_x_poly, train_y)
# The coefficients
print ('Coefficients: ', clf.coef_)
print ('Intercept: ',clf.intercept_)


# In[ ]:


'''
As mentioned before, Coefficient and Intercept , are the parameters of the fit curvy line. 
Given that it is a typical multiple linear regression, with 3 parameters, 
and knowing that the parameters are the intercept and coefficients of hyperplane, 
sklearn has estimated them from our new set of feature sets. Lets plot it:
'''


# In[9]:


plt.scatter(train.ENGINESIZE, train.CO2EMISSIONS,  color='blue')
XX = np.arange(0.0, 10.0, 0.1)
yy = clf.intercept_[0]+ clf.coef_[0][1]*XX+ clf.coef_[0][2]*np.power(XX, 2)
plt.plot(XX, yy, '-r' )
plt.xlabel("Engine size")
plt.ylabel("Emission")

#Evaluation

test_y_ = clf.predict(test_x_poly)

print("Residual sum of squares (MSE): %.2f" % np.mean((test_y_ - test_y) ** 2))
